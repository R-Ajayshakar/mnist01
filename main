The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset used for training and testing in the field of machine learning for handwritten digit recognition. 
The article aims to explore the MNIST dataset, its characteristics and its significance in machine learning.
The MINST dataset stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology". The dataset contains a large collection of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. 
The dataset was created by re-mixing samples from NIST's original datasets, which were taken from American Census Bureau employees and high school students. 
It is designed to help scientists develop and test machine learning algorithms in pattern recognition and machine learning. 
It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of which is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.

Structure of MNIST dataset:
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels. 
Here is the dataset information in the specified format:
  Number of Instances: 70,000 images
  Number of Attributes: 784 (28x28 pixels)
  Target: Column represents the digit (0-9) corresponding to the handwritten image
  Pixel 1-784: Each pixel value (0-255) represents the grayscale intensity of the corresponding pixel in the image.
  The dataset is divided into two main subsets:
  Training Set: Consists of 60,000 images along with their labels, commonly used for training machine learning models.
  Test Set: Contains 10,000 images with their corresponding labels, used for evaluating the performance of trained models.
